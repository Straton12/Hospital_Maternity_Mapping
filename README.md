# Maternity Benefit Package Review

## Project Overview
This project focuses on mapping healthcare facilities to support the review of the Maternity Benefit Package. It provides tools for analyzing the spatial distribution of healthcare facilities (Level 2, 3, 4, and 5) and their proximity to each other. The objective is to identify gaps in healthcare service coverage and provide actionable insights through an interactive web map.

## Features
### Spatial Analysis
- **Level 5 Facilities**:
  - Identify Level 5 facilities without a Level 2, 3, or 4 facility within 2 km, 5 km, 10 km, and 15 km radii.
- **Level 4 Facilities**:
  - Identify Level 4 facilities without a Level 2 or 3 facility within 2 km, 5 km, 10 km, and 15 km radii.

### Interactive Web Map
- Display all healthcare facilities and their respective buffer zones.
- Toggle Level 2, 3, and 4 facilities within defined radii.
- Click on facilities to view details (e.g., level, ownership).
